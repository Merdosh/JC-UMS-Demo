JC-UMS-Demo
===========

For the JC Groep, this is a UMS demo written in C++. It is not intended for any real world functionality, but may provide some inspirations none the less. 
Publicly published with permission of the JC Groep.

The assignment is to show off some of the programming skills in the chosen language by implementing a User Management System (UMS).
Due to the nature of the JC Groep activities prior to my hiring the assignment is aimed more towards web portal design, so I took some liberties and extended the assignment slightly to make it a better fit with C++ without acutually having to program an entire webserver first.

####NOTE:
Some choices in this project have been made to showcase a slightly more complex programming practice instead of that which would make the most efficient real-world code. However, at every stage these choices have been kept in mind to determine whether they would have an impact on excessive code complexity and where nescessary some choices may be reverted during the development of the system. On a whole the reader should consider the presented design a suggestion, not a guide to best-practise. Two examples of these choices are the level and amount of inheritance in the system and the high level of completeness of the class diagram.
