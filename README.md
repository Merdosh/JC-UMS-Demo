JC-UMS-Demo
===========

For the JC Groep, this is a UMS demo written in C++. It is not intended for any real world functionality, but may provide some inspirations none the less. 
Publicly published with permission of the JC Group.

The assignment is to show off some of the programming skills in the chosen language by implementing a User Management System (UMS).
Due to the nature of the JC Groep activities prior to my hiring the assignment is aimed more towards web portal design, so I took some liberties and extended the assignment slightly to make it a better fit with C++ without acutally having to program an entire webserver first.

Target Platform: Windows Desktop
Environment: Microsoft Visual Studio 2012
Tools used: Visual Paradigm for UML - CE (free for non commercial use); Doxygen.
Locations:
*   ./doc/ - Folder containing documentation. 
        Both a DoxyGen manual set and the UML charts created for the project.
*   ./bin/ - Pre-Compiled software. Compiled in Windows7 64bit. No guarantees given.
*   ./src/ - Folder containing a structured source code.

If there are any questions, or project requests concerning this code or the ideas therein, one can feel free to use the above e-mail on the provision that I may take a little while to respond, might I be busy working on billable projects. I have a very easy policy: Those who are patient will be rewarded, those who nag will be discarded. I prefer rhymes, they last longer.
